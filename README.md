## Challenges and Solutions

### CAPTCHA Handling
- **Issue**: CAPTCHA can't be automated ethically.
- **Solution**: Added a manual prompt to solve CAPTCHA before proceeding.

### Dynamic Security Questions
- **Issue**: Security questions vary each time.
- **Solution**: Used dynamic text matching to identify the question and provide the correct answer.

### Website Layout Changes
- **Issue**: Changing website structure could break automation.
- **Solution**: Used robust XPath locators and error handling to adjust if elements are not found.

### Disclaimer
- This script is intended for personal and educational use only.
